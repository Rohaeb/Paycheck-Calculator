# Paycheck-Calculator
This GUI is used for calculating a paycheck by asking various questions to a user including hourly rate, hours worked, ovetime etc. I created this as I wanted to create a small project using Python with Tkinter to create a simple GUI. I use it to calculate my paycheck that I should be expecting after working the necessary hours and overtime. This was first created as a bash script in linux, but wanted to transform it to a GUI for a better using experience.
